# Pantheon ICR Empty Upstream for WordPress Multisite

This is an empty repository that is, save for this explanatory text, devoid of all content. This upstream is used for ICR sites to create WordPress Multisite installations. If this README persists after the site creation, it will do no harm; however, it would be advisable to replace this text with a description of the project.
